Onboarding for CodeDay Labs internship

I am a student at North Seattle College (NSC) in the BAS AppDev program. I currently work at a technology company in marketing and I'm interested in moving into a more technical role, so I started taking some intro programming classes a few years ago at NSC and eventually went into the AppDev program. I'd like to move into product or technical program management.
